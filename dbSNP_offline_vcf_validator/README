Introduction:
This is a customized script to validate vcf files prepared for dbSNP submission.
The code base is almost identical to dbSNP online vcf submission validator
(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/snp_vcf_submission_validator.cgi).
The purpose is to:
1. Improve data submission quality to dbSNP.
2. The submitter can fix the error locally reduced time and interaction with dbSNP staff.
3. The submitter can integrate into their high volume workflow instead of uploading to the
   online validator manually.
4. Reduce burden on NCBI web resources.
5. Provide transparency and make codes open source.

The script was developed on a Linux platform, and it was not planned to run on a non-Linux platform.
Thus please run it on a Linux environment.


To use the script, user need to:
1. Extract files (in a Linux shell): tar -xvf offline_vcf_validator.tar
2. Install required Perl modules (LWP::Simple, XML::XPath, XML::XPath::XMLParser, File::Basename Data::Dumper),
   make sure the installed Perl modules is under Perl's module search path (PERL5LIB).  Also make sure the
   script directory (offline_vcf_validator) is also in PERL5LIB.
3. Provide the reference genome file in fasta format (uncompressed or gzip compressed).  For details,
   refer to 'Customized genome fasta' section at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/docs/submission/vcf_online_validator/.
4. Provide a chromosome identifier mapping file.  The chromosome identifier mapping file is a two-column,
   tab-delimited file to provide the association between molecules in the customized assembly and the
   identifiers in the VCF file: the first column contains the VCF identifiers under the '#CHROM' column,
   and the second column will contain the corresponding identifiers from the definition line(s) of
   the reference genome fasta file.  For details, refer to 'Chromosome identifier mapping file' section
   at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/snp/docs/submission/vcf_online_validator/.

Running the validator:
./dbsnp_vcf_sub_validator.pl -file example_data_from_custom_genome.vcf.gz -gi_list example_custom_genome.chr.mapping -skip_dense 0 -getseq_path GetSeqFromFasta.pl -genome_fasta example_custom_genome.fa.gz


Result:
After script completes, the following output is expected:

dbSNP vcf submission file validation result

Reference genome: custome_genome.
Submission type: Variation and Genotype/Frequency
Number of variation types:
        DIV: 79
        SNV: 902

Filter summary:
        .: 981

Validation status: ERROR

Problem in the content:
        Ref allele mismatch: 1
